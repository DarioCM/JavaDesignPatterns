The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects.
In this pattern, when one object (known as the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers)
are automatically notified and updated.
This pattern promotes a loosely coupled design where the subject and observers are independent of each other.
